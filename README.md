###Task:
Task found in: __Task1.java__

Write a function that, given a list and a target sum, returns zero-based indices of any two distinct elements whose sum is equal to the target sum. 
If there are no such elements, the function should return null.

For example, `findTwoSum(new int[] { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 }, 12)` should return any of the following tuples of indices:

* 1, 4 (3 + 9 = 12)
* 2, 3 (5 + 7 = 12)
* 3, 2 (7 + 5 = 12)
* 4, 1 (9 + 3 = 12)
